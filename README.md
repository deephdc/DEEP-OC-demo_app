# DEEP-OC-demo_app

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=Pipeline-as-code/DEEP-OC-org/DEEP-OC-demo_app/master)](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/job/Pipeline-as-code/job/DEEP-OC-org/job/DEEP-OC-demo_app/job/master)

This is a container that will run the [demo_app](https://github.com/deephdc/demo_app) application leveraging the DEEP as a Service API component ([DEEPaaS API V2](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS)).

> TODO: create two branches of DEEP-OC that match the two branches in demo-app (master, return-files), so that two different container are built.


## Running the container

### Directly from Docker Hub

To run the Docker container directly from Docker Hub and start using the API simply run the following command:
```bash
docker run -ti -p 5000:5000 -p 6006:6006 -p 8888:8888 deephdc/deep-oc-demo_app
```

This command will pull the Docker container from the Docker Hub [deephdc](https://hub.docker.com/u/deephdc/) repository and start the default command (`deepaas-run --listen-ip=0.0.0.0`).

**N.B.** For either CPU-based or GPU-based images you can also use [udocker](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker).

### Building the container

If you want to build the container directly in your machine (because you want to modify the `Dockerfile` for instance) run the following instructions:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deephdc/DEEP-OC-demo_app
cd DEEP-OC-demo_app
docker build -t deephdc/deep-oc-demo_app .
docker run -ti -p 5000:5000 -p 6006:6006 -p 8888:8888 deephdc/deep-oc-demo_app
```

These three steps will download the repository from GitHub and will build the Docker container locally on your machine. You can inspect and modify the `Dockerfile` in order to check what is going on. For instance, you can pass the `--debug=True` flag to the `deepaas-run` command, in order to enable the debug mode.


## Connect to the API

Once the container is up and running, browse to http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui to get the [OpenAPI (Swagger)](https://www.openapis.org/) documentation page.
